    "doi": "10.1021/acscatal.3c00759",
    "abstract": "Electrocatalysis takes a significant role in the production of sustainable fuels and chemicals. The combination of artificial intelligence and catalytic science is exhibiting great potential to extract, analyze, and predict electrocatalysts. However, the currently developed machine learning approach usually requires a mass of data from density functional theory calculations to train and optimize models. In contrast, a knowledge graph has the potential to extract useful information from a large amount of the literature without referring to density functional theory. Herein, a knowledge graph of Cu-based electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is constructed based on a linguistically enriched SciBERT-based framework. This framework retrieves multiple types of entities including material, regulation method, product, Faradaic efficiency, etc. from 757 scientific literature, generates representations with abundant domain-specific semantic information, and exhibits the capability to deal with electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. The obtained graph shows the development history of related catalysts, builds relationships between the factors associated with catalysis, and provides intuitive charts for researchers to gain useful information. Furthermore, we propose a deep learning-based prediction model, which integrates the semantic information from the scientific literature (word embedding) with the correlation of knowledge triples (graph embedding) and realizes the prediction of the Faradaic efficiency for a targeted case. This work paves the way for catalyst design in the manner of merging artificial intelligence with catalytic science."

    "doi": "10.1039/D3DD00067B",
    "abstract": "Materials knowledge is inherently hierarchical. While high-level descriptors such as composition and structure are valuable for contextualizing materials data, the data must ultimately be considered in the context of its low-level acquisition details. Graph databases offer an opportunity to represent hierarchical relationships among data, organizing semantic relationships into a knowledge graph. Herein, we establish a knowledge graph of materials experiments whose construction encodes the complete provenance of each material sample and its associated experimental data and metadata. Additional relationships among materials and experiments further encode knowledge and facilitate data exploration. We illustrate the Materials Experiment Knowledge Graph (MekG) using several use cases, demonstrating the value of modern graph databases for the enterprise of data-driven materials science."

    "authors": "Zhiwei Nie, Shisheng Zheng, Yuanji Liu, Zhefeng Chen, Shunning Li, Kai Lei, Feng Pan",
    "year": 2022,
    "doi": "10.1002/adfm.202201437",
    "abstract": "The recent marriage of materials science and artificial intelligence has created the need to extract and collate materials information from the tremendous backlog of academic publications. However, this is notoriously hard to achieve in sophisticated application domains, such as Li-ion battery (LIB) cathodes, which require multiple variables for materials selection, making it challenging to automatically identify the critical terms in the text. Herein, a semantics representation framework, featuring a dual-attention module that refines word embeddings through multi-source information fusion, is proposed for literature mining of LIB cathodes. The word embeddings thus produced are biased toward domain-specific knowledge and can enable the detection of deep-seated associations among materials for targeted applications. Based on this framework, we establish a semantic knowledge graph dedicated to LIB cathodes, which allows us to unravel the latent materials relationships from scientific literature and even to discover candidate materials not yet exploited as cathodes before. This work provides a long-sought path to the realization of text-mining-based knowledge management for complicated materials systems with little dependence on domain expertise."
