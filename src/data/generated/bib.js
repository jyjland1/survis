        "abstract": "Electrocatalysis takes a significant role in the production of sustainable fuels and chemicals. The combination of artificial intelligence and catalytic science is exhibiting great potential to extract, analyze, and predict electrocatalysts. However, the currently developed machine learning approach usually requires a mass of data from density functional theory calculations to train and optimize models. In contrast, a knowledge graph has the potential to extract useful information from a large amount of the literature without referring to density functional theory. Herein, a knowledge graph of Cu-based electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic CO2\u00a0reduction is constructed based on a linguistically enriched SciBERT-based framework. This framework retrieves multiple types of entities including material, regulation method, product, Faradaic efficiency, etc. from 757 scientific literature, generates representations with abundant domain-specific semantic information, and exhibits the capability to deal with electrocatalysts for CO2\u00a0reduction. The obtained graph shows the development history of related catalysts, builds relationships between the factors associated with catalysis, and provides intuitive charts for researchers to gain useful information. Furthermore, we propose a deep learning-based prediction model, which integrates the semantic information from the scientific literature (word embedding) with the correlation of knowledge triples (graph embedding) and realizes the prediction of the Faradaic efficiency for a targeted case. This work paves the way for catalyst design in the manner of merging artificial intelligence with catalytic science.",

        "abstract": "Due to the massive growth of scientific publications, literature mining is becoming increasingly popular for researchers to thoroughly explore scientific text and extract such data to create new databases or augment existing databases. Efforts in literature-mining software design and implementation have improved text-mining productivity, but most of the toolkits that mine text are based on traditional machine-learning-algorithms which hinder the performance of downstream text-mining tasks. Natural-language processing (NLP) and text-mining technologies have seen a rapid development since the release of transformer models, such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). Upgrading rule-based or machine-learning-based literature-mining toolkits by embedding transformer models into the software is therefore likely to improve their text-mining performance. To this end, we release a Python-based literature-mining toolkit for the field of battery materials, BatteryDataExtractor, which involves the embedding of BatteryBERT models in its automated data-extraction pipeline. This pipeline employs BERT models for token-classification tasks, such as abbreviation detection, part-of-speech tagging, and chemical-named-entity recognition, as well as new double-turn question-answering data-extraction models for auto-generating repositories of inter-related material and property data as well as general information. We demonstrate that BatteryDataExtractor exhibits state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation data sets for both token classification and automated data extraction. To aid the use of BatteryDataExtractor, its code is provided as open-source software, with associated documentation to serve as a user guide.",

Knowledge graphs, which provide support for knowledge management, are able to collectively capture the scientific knowledge from the vast collection of research articles and accomplish the automatic recognition of the relationships between entities. In this work, a materials knowledge graph, named MatKG, is constructed, which establishes a unique correspondence between subjects and objects in the materials science area. An emphasis is placed on the disambiguation of authors, addressed by a deduplication model based on machine learning and matching dependencies algorithms. Specifically, MatKG is applied to perform tracking on research trends in the study of LiFePO4\u00a0and to automatically chronicle the milestones achieved so far. It is believed that MatKG can serve as a versatile research platform for amalgamating and refining the scientific knowledge of materials in a variety of subfields and intersectional domains.",

        "abstract": "The recent marriage of materials science and artificial intelligence has created the need to extract and collate materials information from the tremendous backlog of academic publications. However, this is notoriously hard to achieve in sophisticated application domains, such as Li-ion battery (LIB) cathodes, which require multiple variables for materials selection, making it challenging to automatically identify the critical terms in the text. Herein, a semantics representation framework, featuring a dual-attention module that refines word embeddings through multi-source information fusion, is proposed for literature mining of LIB cathodes. The word embeddings thus produced are biased toward domain-specific knowledge and can enable the detection of deep-seated associations among materials for targeted applications. Based on this framework, we establish a semantic knowledge graph dedicated to LIB cathodes, which allows us to unravel the latent materials relationships from scientific literature and even to discover candidate materials not yet exploited as cathodes before. This work provides a long-sought path to the realization of text-mining-based knowledge management for complicated materials systems with little dependence on domain expertise.",

The interdisciplinary cooperation of materials science and computer science makes it more accurate and efficient to explore the relationship between material microstructure and material properties. Machine learning has potential in exploring the relationship between microstructure and properties of materials. This paper proposes adding the morphology features of grains into the construction of grain knowledge graph to enrich the grain information in the graph. First, an autoencoder extracts the grain morphology features and adds them to the grain knowledge graph. Then, the graph convolutional network is used to extract the features of the graph, and the fully connected network is used to predict the properties of the material. Experiments are performed on actual EBSD scanning data. The experimental results show that the proposed method has noticeable improvement over the competing methods.",

While high-level descriptors such as composition and structure are valuable for contextualizing materials data, the data must ultimately be considered in the context of its low-level acquisition details. Graph databases offer an opportunity to represent hierarchical relationships among data, organizing semantic relationships into a knowledge graph. Herein, we establish a knowledge graph of materials experiments whose construction encodes the complete provenance of each material sample and its associated experimental data and metadata. Additional relationships among materials and experiments further encode knowledge and facilitate data exploration. We illustrate the Materials Experiment Knowledge Graph (MekG) using several use cases, demonstrating the value of modern graph databases for the enterprise of data-driven materials science.",

MGED-KG is the most comprehensive KG for materials terminology in both Chinese and English languages, consisting of 8,660 terms and their explanations. It encompasses 11 principal categories, such as Metals, Composites, Nanomaterials, each with two or three levels of subcategories, resulting in a total of 235 distinct category labels. For further application, a knowledge web system based on MGED-KG is developed and shows its great power in improving data sharing efficiency from the aspects of query expansion, term, and data recommendation.",

        "abstract": "Lithium battery disassembly is a complex task that presents numerous challenges, including the wide variety of battery types, intricate manufacturing processes, and the absence of standardised procedures. These challenges pose significant obstacles in achieving efficient and accurate disassembly operations. Consequently, there is a clear need for guidance and support throughout the disassembly process. Conventional strategies for providing disassembly guidance often struggle to adapt to the dynamic changes that occur during the process. Therefore, it is essential to develop an approach that offers flexibility, efficiency, and adaptability to real-time visual cues in order to effectively address these challenges. This paper introduces a novel real-time visual guidance scheme that utilises a sophisticated multi-modal event knowledge graph. By leveraging outputs from computer vision models, the proposed scheme monitors the disassembly process in real-time and provides visually triggered, context-sensitive guidance through the multi-modal event knowledge graph. Additionally, this paper presents an auxiliary training method for visual state detection, guided by the large-scale visual model known as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which helps mitigate the costs associated with data annotation during model development. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through experimental evaluations, demonstrating its potential in enhancing disassembly efficiency.",
